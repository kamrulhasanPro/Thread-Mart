# 🧵 Thread Mart – Garments Marketplace & Management Platform

Thread Mart is a role-based garments marketplace platform where multiple **Managers** can list and sell products, **Buyers** can purchase garments, and **Thread Mart** acts as the central marketing, management, and control system.  
The platform focuses on garment-related products with structured dashboards for **Admin**, **Manager**, and **Buyer** roles.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The purpose of Thread Mart is to create a centralized platform that:

- Allows multiple garment managers to sell products under one system
- Connects buyers with verified garment sellers
- Handles marketing visibility and system control from a single platform
- Ensures secure, role-based access for all users

Thread Mart works as the **middle layer** between buyers and managers, similar to a multi-vendor marketplace.
